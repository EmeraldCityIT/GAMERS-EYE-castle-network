# Gundam-EYE-castle-network
Gundam is developing gaming networks using rackmount servers for competitions, training exercises, and events.
Give your team the cutting edge in competition with over 100gb ram per gaming machine and multiple processors.
Your desk only needs a monitor and controls. Your team is linked on a private network which is consolidated in a rolling rack which you can bring to competition. Arrange your workstations near the rack and mobilize against the other team with terabytes of RAM. We are developing novel methods for rackmount GPU cooling using peltier coolers and pure copper heatsinks.


Setting up multiple stations from one mobile rack.
HDMI cables have a maximum reccomended length of 50 ft.
Wireless mouse and keyboard are reccomended.
USB cables operate at a maximum reccomended length of 16 ft.
